## Devlogs
### W1
Write your W1 activity Devlog here.\
Hello World!\
Pretend I wrote a beautiful metaphor describing Components, GameObjects, and Scenes here.

### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.\
Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings?\
The RBG values that are stored need need decimal values to acurately represent the data of the color. Not an string because it is not storing characters. Not a bool because it is not storing a true or flase state.\
Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?\
Bounces are whole numbers therefor having and INT variable is more efficent to track number of bounces and store them.\
The error you got after Step X of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?\
You can't natively add int and float variables in the code without the "f" declaration. Nummber storage types do not go together.\

### W3
Table #6
You’re building a rhythm game, and you’re writing a method named DidPlayerHitBeat that tells you whether or not the player accurately hit a beat based on the time that they pressed a key.
The input parameters DidPLayerHitBeat would input is the key.input and timeinput. By comparing the input and the time of input with the time of accurate hit is less than margin of error in seconds like 1 second.  We can return a boolean of true or false.\n
Classes are like rectangle while components are squares. Component and Classes are similar as they both contains methods and varible to create functions. Classes are like blueprints able to be edited and developed for certain unique functions. Components are reusable classes which functions that can be spread and use for common use.\n
The balls in the scene become extremely bright because the getcolormultipler is being called as the speedthreshold is being reached over surpassed.\n
